<summary><b>Git and repo:</b> :arrow_down: </summary>

* Git trees should be maintained in a tidy and organized manner
* Official release branches must be named after current Android version, e.g. Android 14 -branch_name-> 14.0, this naming is mandatory
* In the case of incompatibility with current, already hosted device sources, maintainers will need to create a dedicated branch for their device on said repos (eg. *14.0-whyred*)
* Maintainers are free to create additional backup/testing branches
* Original commit authorship must be maintained
* Commits must preserve proper and informative naming
* Commits must describe the change, especially reverts. Commits without proper messages are meaningless, showing that you have no actual idea what you’re doing. 
* Reverts without a message doesn’t let others know what problem it was causing and it is generally bad for community
* Rebasing and force-pushing is allowed as long as it doesn’t affect other users badly
* Don’t force-push main branch of a common dt repository until consulted with all maintainers using it
* When force-pushing a branch it is advised to create a copy of it just in case, named *'mybranch-old'* or *'mybranch-today's date'*
